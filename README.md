# For Joy Over It

My personal blog site built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and minimal dependencies.

## Development

Reference the [Makefile](./Makefile), or simply run `make`, for a list of commonly used development tasks.

Install dependencies and start the dev server. **Requires Docker Desktop**.

```sh
make dev
```

Run tests.

```sh
make test
```
