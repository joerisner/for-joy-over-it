Our Utah boy who shares our name,  
Scarcely a place you are forgotten.  
Your history and ours the same,  
Tied up by moments and emotion.

Your adventure teeth were cut at Wheeler Farm,  
Wonder was birthed in your heart.  
Millcreek Canyon was your first foray skyward,  
Alone with Momma the best part.

Liberty Park, the frisbee place,  
Our little escape in the city.  
At 387 South, a new home awaits,  
With adventures and ordeals aplenty.

Our new basecamp served as a launching pad,  
For wisdom, curiosity and fun.  
Oh the places we'd see!  
Oh the places you'd run!

None more hallowed than Settlement Canyon,  
Where the soil and trees knew your name.  
Stansbury Park was where we went swimming,  
Your happiness on full display.

An easy endeavor at Churchwood Road,  
But one you loved nonetheless.  
Deer Hollow brought challenges that you overcame,  
And now, my good boy, you can rest.

Wherever we were was where you wanted to be,  
And that was our desire as well.  
You are remembered as Prince of Dogs, Riley,  
Be at peace, you ran well.
